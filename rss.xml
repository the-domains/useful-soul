            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Ars VR headset showdown-Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive</h1><p>In our original reviews of the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, we tried very hard to examine these virtual reality systems on their own merits without constant comparisons to the competition. But no product exists in a vacuum. After years of buildup, we're now faced with two competitive, PC-tethered VR headsets hitting the market right next to each other.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a473611978ca4931a0d74678d9cd4a6eaafdb8a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

This is simply because most of us have one WiFi router for our entire home, and that just doesn't work for how we use Internet today.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75956575966b1c70c11ff614cb972cd2133a6a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>
